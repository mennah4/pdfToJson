        "My passion is building things. I'm a Materials Scientist and Bioengineer, but I love all things related to creation. I'm an artist and a scientist (see my website at http://shilpikachowdhury.com) but I also like to explore different industries and learn about new technologies. You may have noticed the diversity of experiences in my profile, and I believe that this experience gives me a fresh perspective when approaching problems. Many people tell me that they appreciate my ability to predict issues right from the start and plan solutions into my designs. ",
        "My ideal work would be harnessing my ability to quickly understand and communicate facets of new technologies to connect technologies that deserve to be together. I also like to derive mathematic relations (people call them back of the envelope) and to see trends in data and iterate on approaches. I derive a lot of pleasure from carefully designing something that eventually I get to hold in my hands. ",
        "Most of my experience is in wafer processing (microfab), electron microscopy, and dealing with material- organism interactions. I also use quite a bit of 3D printing for prototyping, and my favorite tool is a laser cutter. ",
        "I have industry experience, and I like to think that the best way to innovate at this point is to process the IP that already exists and compress that into a paradigm shift. My mission in life is to optimize and initiate the personalized preventative care movement. And to do it right. "

I salvaged parts from a printer, scanner, and CD drive and created a 3D model of how I wanted the machine to look and perform. From this model, I was able to create a wooden frame and complete the mechanical assembly of the plotter. Then using a standard microcontroller, I was able to create an electrical distribution system that gave each motor the right amount of power. I customized firmware for the microcontroller to accurately drive my salvaged motors. The completed plotter interprets g-code to create drawings.VIDEO CAN BE SEEN HERE: www.dropbox.com/s/xcau5kzvdnt5esq/cncpencil.mp4?dl=0"
